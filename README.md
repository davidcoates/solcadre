# Solcadre

**Solcadre** is a week-based, solar-structured calendar system designed for building stable routines, long-term programs, and intentional transitions.

It treats the **week as the atomic unit of time**, divides the year into **four fixed 12-week seasons**, and explicitly includes **transition weeks** between seasons.

Solcadre is not about tracking dates — it’s about structuring time you can live in.

## Core ideas

- **Weeks are invariant**  
  Every week starts on the same day. Weekly routines never drift.

- **Seasons are fixed-length**  
  Each season is exactly 12 weeks, making them ideal for training blocks, projects, or focused periods of work.

- **Transitions are intentional**  
  One or two transition weeks sit between seasons, aligned closely with the solstices and equinoxes, and intended for rest, review, or change.

- **Solar, without complexity**  
  The calendar tracks the solar year at the seasonal level while keeping week-level structure clean and regular.

## Why Solcadre?

Solcadre was designed for people who plan in **weeks and programs**, not individual dates.

It works especially well when you want:
- routines anchored to a consistent weekday
- comparable, repeatable seasons
- built-in time for recovery or reset

## Status

This repository contains the Solcadre calendar definition, reference implementations, and supporting tools.

Solcadre is intended to be simple, stable, and boring — in the best possible way.
